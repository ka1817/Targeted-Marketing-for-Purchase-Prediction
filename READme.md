# Machine Learning Project for Predicting TargetBuy

## Overview
This project is aimed at predicting whether a customer will make a purchase (`TargetBuy`) based on various demographic and loyalty features. The dataset includes multiple attributes such as demographic affiliation, age, gender, loyalty class, loyalty spend, and loyalty time.

The process includes:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Data Splitting**
- **Applying Machine Learning Algorithms**
- **Model Tracking with MLflow**
- **Versioning and Collaboration with DagsHub**
